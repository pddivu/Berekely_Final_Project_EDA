#### Executive summary

The organization XXX, with a global footprint in a specific range of products, anticipates challenges in achieving its projected revenue targets in the coming years due to increasing competition within the product market segments. To regain and retain business and customers, the organization aims to leverage AI/ML to uncover product associations and relationships, in  identifying opportunities for revenue growth.
Recommended Solution:
The data team put forth the idea of a part recommender logic (ML model) for the customers, by analyzing the sales data to increase sales by implementing it in an ecommerce platform as well as to train the sale representative who accepts customer call. 
The ML model will analyze the organization sale history to trace the high revenue customers, as well as the products purchased together at their different customer sites. These products will be grouped and will be analyzed in detail to trace if any of the products from the grouping are in decline in recent sales. The decline in the product or the product family is an indication that the competitor is already in the take the market share.

#### Rationale
Need to build a part recommender logic(ML model) for the customers to increase sale by implementing it in ecommerce platform as well as to train the sale representative who accepts customer call. 
Detailed description:  XXX company sells various products around the globe. Customers purchases these products for their homes and for offices. XXX company notices there are certain products purchased together by the customer in most of their orders. So XXX company wants to build a part recommender model to implement in their e commerce as well as educate the sale representatives to encourage customers to buy these recommended parts together.
So if one customer purchased product A and B together in past orders, next time any customer adds product A to their shopping cart, product B will be listed at the bottom as recommended product  to buy along with a small discount to increase the sale.
